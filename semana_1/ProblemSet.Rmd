## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Video: Diamonds
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```

Video: Price Histogram
```{r}
# Create a histogram of the price of
# all the diamonds in the diamond data set.

library(ggplot2)

qplot(x=price, data = diamonds,  color=I('pink'), fill=I('black'))
```

Video: Price Histogram Summary
```{r}
summary(diamonds$price)
```

Video: Diamond Counts
```{r}
custo_menor_que_500 <- subset(diamonds, price < 500)
custo_menor_que_250 <- subset(diamonds, price < 250)
custo_maior_ou_igua_15000 <- subset(diamonds, price >= 15000)
```

Video: Cheaper Diamonds
```{r}
# Explore the largest peak in the
# price histogram you created earlier.

# Try limiting the x-axis, altering the bin width,
# and setting different breaks on the x-axis.

# There won’t be a solution video for this
# question so go to the discussions to
# share your thoughts and discover
# what other people find.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Submit your final code when you are ready.

qplot(x=price, data = diamonds,  color=I('pink'), fill=I('black'), binwidth=50) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 5000, 500), lim=c(0, 5000))

ggsave('price_histogram.png')
```

Video: Price by Cut Histogram
```{r}
# Break out the histogram of diamond prices by cut.

# You should have five histograms in separate
# panels on your resulting plot.

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds,  color=I('pink'), fill=I('black'), binwidth=50) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 1500, 500), lim=c(0, 1500)) +
  facet_wrap(~cut, ncol = 5)
```

Video: Price by Cut
```{r}
summary(diamonds$price)
# Usei 'min' porque o 'summary' faz algum arredondamento
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, min)
```

Video: Scales and Multiple Histograms
```{r}
# In the two last exercises, we looked at
# the distribution for diamonds by cut.

# Run the code below in R Studio to generate
# the histogram as a reminder.

# ===============================================================

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut)
                                                                               
# ===============================================================

# In the last exercise, we looked at the summary statistics
# for diamond price by cut. If we look at the output table, the
# the median and quartiles are reasonably close to each other.

# diamonds$cut: Fair
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     337    2050    3282    4359    5206   18570 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Good
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     327    1145    3050    3929    5028   18790 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Very Good
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     336     912    2648    3982    5373   18820 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Premium
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     326    1046    3185    4584    6296   18820 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Ideal
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     326     878    1810    3458    4678   18810 

# This means the distributions should be somewhat similar,
# but the histograms we created don't show that.

# The 'Fair' and 'Good' diamonds appear to have 
# different distributions compared to the better
# cut diamonds. They seem somewhat uniform
# on the left with long tails on the right.

# Let's look in to this more.

# Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
# Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
# the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
# be different for each histogram.

# If you want a hint, check out the Instructor Notes.

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut, scales = "free_y")
```

Video: Price per Carat by Cut
```{r}
# Create a histogram of price per carat
# and facet it by cut. You can make adjustments
# to the code from the previous exercise to get
# started.

# Adjust the bin width and transform the scale
# of the x-axis using log10.

qplot(x = log10(price), y = carat, data = diamonds, binwidth = 20) + facet_wrap(~cut, scales = "free_y")
```
